# Wallpaper Scheduler
A simple lightweight program to automatically change your wallpaper to an image at a specified time.

HOW TO USE:
1. Place the .jpg image you want to change you background to into the "Backgrounds" folder of the program.
2. Rename the .jpg image to the time you want it to appear, in 24hr format with a hyphen instead of a colon. (i.e. 13-25.jpg will cause that image to become the background at 13:25 / 1:25pm)
3. Run the Wallpaper Scheduler.exe and the images in the Backgrounds folder will be automatically scheduled.
4. To add new images to the schedule, the .exe must be restarted by simply quitting and relaunching the app.

This is my first ever fully published app + upload onto GitHub, I hope people find it useful.
